##Purpose

Using the Mice expression dataset found on the University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository, 3 classification models were built using various libraries. Specifically, neural networks, logistic regression, and support vector machines. The goal of each model is to accurately train on the dataset and classify which subset of protein expressions belongs to which class of Mice.
