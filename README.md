# BioInformatics and Machine Learning Project

## Purpose:

Using the Mice expression dataset found on the University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository, 3 classification models were built using various libraries. Specifically, neural networks, logistic regression, and support vector machines. The goal of each model is to accurately train on the dataset and classify which subset of protein expressions belongs to which class of Mice. 

## How to Run 

The models were created using Python on Google Colab, hence the .ipynb file. I have also provided the .py version of the file for posterity, however it is simply a auto-coverted version of the .ipynb program and has not been tested. In order to run the google colab program, the user must specify the location of their version of the mice protein expression dataset in the appropriate location along with the all the libraries used.
